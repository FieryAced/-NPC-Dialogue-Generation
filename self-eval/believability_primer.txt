NPC: Hello. Buying or browsing? Got all sorts of weapons for all your needs!
Player: I'd like to buy a weapon for self-defense.
NPC: Looking for anything specific?
Player: Something small, preferably concealable, and easy to use.
NPC: Try this taser gun. Shoots up to 20 meters away. 
Player: Need something with a bit more...Stopping power.
NPC: Ah, I see. A taser will stop most humans and humanoids but I think I understand what you're looking for.
Player:
NPC: I think you'll find this to be sufficient for your needs. It's a plasma pistol, accurate to 80 meters. Melts through most organic and some inorganic material like a hot knife through butter! Enough "stopping power" for you?
Player: Perfect. How much is it?
NPC: This piece will cost you 16000 credits. Another 10000 for a case of ammo.
Player: So expensive...Fine.
NPC: Pleasure doing business.
